brendan, you have to email the comotion (tech transfer) and see what they want.  
i'm going to guess this software belongs to uw, ideally it is free (as in beer) 
for academics and government organizations, uw owns all modifications to the software, the software
is provided as is, and you cannot hold uw liable.  i don't think gpl will be a good license
choice.  if this library is to exist in the shakealert framework gpl licensing can very easily 
find itself conflicting with caltech licensed software.  but that's the usgs's problem and not yours.
